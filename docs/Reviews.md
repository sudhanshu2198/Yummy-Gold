    I'm so impressed with this cold-pressed mustard oil. The packaging is super sturdy and spill-proof, which is a huge plus. The design of the spout makes pouring a breeze. No strong smell and no eye irritation. I've tried other oils that made me cough or water up a storm, but this one is a game-changer. Overall, I'm hooked. Highly recommend this mustard oil for its quality, design, and health benefits.

     Being a Rajasthani Marwadi we have a lot of dishes using mustard oil which are very rich in taste so I keep on looking for great mustard oil which has perfect smell and enhances the taste of the food and this one actually makes the dish smell great and have great taste and perfectly blend in the food.The oil has a strong aroma adds a nice flavour to the curry and since it's cold pressed it's a healthier option.

    We have Mustard oil as a part of our cooking for multiple health benefits it serves. This product I tried for the first time, moment you open the bottle the aroma is so prominent and awesome. It has typical pungent mustard taste which gives nice flavor to food.

    The oil has a good aroma as well as taste. Also, the quality and the packaging is very good. I used it to prepare fried rice and I must say it tastes very good with no pungent taste/smell.
